## Workflow

- Add this action to your repo
- Commit some changes
- push either to **master** or any other branch specified in the workflow
- On **push (or merge)**, the action will:
    - Get the latest commit hash and timestamp
    - Generate a custom string using the above two arguments

### NOTE

This action just generates a custom string which can be used as an output to release a tag with custom name.
If you also want to release this tag to `GitHub`, add this action [GitHub Script](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-script)
to your workflow file .
